Submit a PDF with your work on iLearn. You will find the “man” command to be very useful.
Make sure your Raspberry PI is up.
Open a terminal, run the ifconfig command and record the output.
Submit the output as a screenshot (5pts) Include the following information for the eth0 interface IP address, Ethernet Address, netmask, and MTU (20pts) Run ping between two PIs and record the output.</description></item><item><title>Program 2</title><link>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:09:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa2/</guid><description>This is a GROUP Assignment
Submit your work on iLearn.
