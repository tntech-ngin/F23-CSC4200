Submit a PDF with your work on iLearn. You will find the “man” command to be very useful.
Make sure your Raspberry PI is up.
Open a terminal, run the ifconfig command and record the output.
Submit the output as a screenshot (5pts) Include the following information for the eth0 interface IP address, Ethernet Address, netmask, and MTU (20pts) Run ping between two PIs and record the output.</description></item><item><title>Program 2</title><link>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:09:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa2/</guid><description>This is a GROUP Assignment
Submit your work on iLearn.
Objectives
Learn to create network packets.
Learn how packets can be sent over the network.
Familiarize you with the concept of sockets.
Learn packing structures, endianness, unpacking, and interpreting network data.
Learn how to use actual data from a packet.
Use packet capture to visually inspect protocols.
Overview
In this warmup project, you are going to implement a client and a server program that will send a command over the network.</description></item><item><title>Program 3</title><link>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa3/</guid><description>Interact with the cloud thorugh a gateway
Objectives
In this project, you are going to build on the first project. You will have a gateway (your PI) that downloads a command from a remote web page. The client (your partner&amp;rsquo;s PI) is not secure and can not connect to the network. However, it can talk to the gateway to retrieve the command. It then perfors the command (LIGHTON and LIGHTOFF).</description></item><item><title>Program 4</title><link>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/S23-CSC4200/docs/prologue/pa4/</guid><description>Due Date - April 28, 2023 #
Objectives
In this project, you are going to build on the first and the second project. You will have a server serves a large file. You will have clients connect to the server and retrive this file. You will use an AIMD congestion control algorithm and compare with your previous assignment. The client and server communications MUST use UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) and NOT TCP.</description></item></channel></rss>
